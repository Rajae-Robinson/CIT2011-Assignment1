			<h2>My Strengths</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
					<p>I am an excellent problem solver and a great thinker. As a result, I enjoy Programming as it allows me 
					to solve problems. I have been developing this trait in the last five years by constantly seeking out new problems to solve
					particularly those that require use of computer algorithms.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Organized</h3>
					<p>I am highly organized. I need to keep track of tasks that I need to be done because I have a packed schedule.
					Over the past five years, I have been developing this trait by having a journal were I make note and keep track of my tasks.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Creativity</h3>
					<p>I have always been a creative person. I love learning and many different topics interest me. I have been developing this trait in the past 
					five years my reading various books and exposing myself to different types of music and art.</p>
