			<p>People who have interacted with me would describe me as reserved. I am intoverted and so, I prefer my own company.
				I am a calm and rational person. For the most part, I am not very expressive when interacting with others. Some consider this
				trait to be negative, but my family and close friends don't mind. I would consider myself to be an intellectual as I tend
				to be analytical and I am constantly thinking. In my pastime I enjoy reading and coding. My favorite books to read often center around Psychology or Philosophy.
				I enjoy books like these because they introduce me t novel ideas and more profound topics.

				My favorite psychologist and role model is Carl Jung. His psychological method emphasizes on increasing self-understanding and bringing our subconcious to conciousness. My favorite quote from Jung is
				"The world will ask you who you are, and if you don't know, the world will tell you." This quote made be realize the importance of seeking to become who I truly am in order to not just be a mere copy of
				everyone else.
